## Helping purpose-driven organizations reduce their negative app reviews

### Are your app reviews limiting the positive impact you want to have?

I'm a mobile app quality consultant who helps purpose-driven organizations reduce their negative mobile app reviews. Unlike similar consultants, I offer a 100% money-back satisfaction guarantee.

My goal is to help you achieve long-term positive impact by bringing my expertise from 10 years of planning, coding, and improving native mobile apps with everything that can go wrong while doing so ;)
I see negative app reviews as only a symptom, and together we can find out what is the best way to improve the actual cause. I guarantee better app reviews as a result.


I'm always on the look for long-term thinking organisations that aim to have a big positive impact on our society and our planet.

As an app quality expert, I help future-focused, purpose-driven organisations with mobile quality issues. These can be purpose-first social businesses, NGOs, or anyone who prefers long-term more than short-term thinking, anyone who makes sustainable decisions out of real commitment instead of just responding to the market in a green-washing way. I also prefer self-sustained over investor-led organisations.
